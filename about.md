## About Us

The Stuhm Bl'ahn Inn is a group of artists, actors, storytellers, and nerds. Yes we each fit those categories to a degree. Our bi-weekly adventures allow us to play a game we love, with people we mostly tolerate, for an audience that can't physically throw over-ripened fruit at us. In all seriousness, please don't throw fruit at us.

We are a few friends who came together late in 2018 to realize the potential of our collective storytelling through Dungeons & Dragons. With a little tech wizardry, caffeine, and lots of artistic skill, The Stuhm Bl'ahn Inn was born. While we can't hope to entertain everyone, we do hope you come along for the ride and let us try!

We do this for free, but we would love you sponsorship! Reach out on one of our social channels to talk more or sponsor us through donations [here](https://streamlabs.com/thestuhmblahninn).
